# Jumble Game in Ruby
## Motivation
The other day I was watching an episode of NewsRadio where Matthew is trying to solve the Jumble of the day printed on the newspaper, at that moment Lisa (Maura Tierney) approaches but she cant figure out the answer, suddenly Kathy comes to the scene and solves the jumble in few seconds. Lisa asks her how did she do it, Kathy says, the words say "pick me, pick me". 
Moving on... I made a quick ddg search and I found Chicago Tribune's Jumble Daily page, free for anyone, after playing I decided to make my own.

I used the following list of [English Words](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/dict/words?view=log)
